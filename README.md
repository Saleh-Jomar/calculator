## Calculator
This calculator project is a requirement in finishing the free online course offered by The Odin Project. The goal is to integrate HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this project, and to practice language syntax and problem solving skills acquired during the course study. 

## Restrictions
In making this project, a few restrictions were introduced to make the experience more challenging.
1. The `eval()` function must not be used. The project requires the developer to create their own functions for each operations.
2. The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers, without sacrificing the continuous use of operations. 

## Functionalities
1. The calculator is expected to do the 4 basic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. The calculator has a sign switcher function to accomodate negative input.
3. The calculator has a decimal point input that can only exist once per number input.
4. The calculator has a backspace function to allow changes for misclicked input.
5. The calculator has a reset function. 

Aside from the required functionalities, I also integrated some useful functions for a better experience when using the calculator.
1. The user input is limited only to 8 characters including the decimal point, to avoid overflowing.
2. Added a rounding function with precision function that is precise up to the largest decimal input.
